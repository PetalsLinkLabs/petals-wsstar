w3c "WS-BASENOTIFICATION" library is organised as follow:

- "architecture/" directory :
	This directory contains a BOUML(*) project which provides
	architecture's concerns respect to "WS-BASENOTIFICATION" library implementation.

- "documentation" directory :
	This directory contains Latex source of related "WS-BASENOTIFICATION" library
	implementation documentation
	
- "wsn-b-datatype-api" directory :
	This directory contains the "Datatype's api" part(**) of the "WS-BASENOTIFICATION"
	library	implementation source code.  
	
- "wsn-b-datatype-jaxbimpl" directory :
 	This directory contains the "Datatype's implementation" part(**), based
        on "Jaxb2.x data binding" tool, of the "WS-BASENOTIFICATION" library implementation
        source code.

- "wsn-b-services" directory :
        This directory contains the "Services' concerns" part (services' interface,
        faults, ...) of the "WS-BASENOTIFICATION" library implementation source code.

(*) : BOUML is a open source free software that help you to design
      your programs using UML langage. See "bouml.free.fr" for more details

(**): "WS-BASENOTIFICATION" specification datatypes are implented follow the "Brigde
	design pattern" - for the ws*factory class - as describe in the Gang of four's
	book : "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".
